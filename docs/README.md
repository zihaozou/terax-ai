# Terax contributor documentation

This directory holds long-form contributor and maintainer guides. `TERAX.md` at the repo root is the living architecture doc and the source of truth; these guides elaborate on specific areas without duplicating it.

If a guide conflicts with `TERAX.md`, `TERAX.md` wins.

## Getting started

- [TERAX.md](../TERAX.md) - the architecture source of truth; read this first
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) - how to contribute, quality bar, project layout

## Architecture guides

- [Two-process model and IPC command reference](architecture/two-process-model.md) - Rust owns all OS access; the webview talks through `invoke()`. Command catalog and how to add a new command.
- [PTY shell integration](architecture/pty-shell-integration.md) - PTY sessions, shell init scripts, OSC 7 / 133, ConPTY, SPAWN_LOCK, Job Object, WSL.
- [Security model](architecture/security-model.md) - workspace authorization, SSRF guard, IPC allowlist, OSC trust, keychain handling.
- [Terminal renderer pool](architecture/terminal-renderer-pool.md) - slot pooling, the DormantRing, and the never-serialize-mid-command invariant.
- [CLI control plane](architecture/cli-control.md) - bundled CLI, authenticated local protocol, caller targeting, packaging, and current platform limits.

## Contributing guides

- [Testing](contributing/testing.md) - the testing contract, how to run checks, and what makes a good core-subsystem test.
