# Contributing to Terax

Terax is a solo-maintained project with a strong product direction. Contributions are welcome, but **alignment matters more than volume**.

This document helps you decide *whether* and *how* to contribute in a way that's likely to get merged, so neither of us wastes time.

## How this project is run

- Terax has one active maintainer ([@crynta](https://github.com/crynta)).
- Review bandwidth is limited.
- Not every contribution can be accepted, even if it's technically correct. Alignment with project direction matters as much as code quality.
- For scope and direction, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Read it before opening anything non-trivial.

This is normal for a solo project. A "no" on a PR is not personal.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Prereqs: Rust (stable), Node 20+, pnpm, plus your platform's [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

For the architecture and how to contribute safely, see [TERAX.md](TERAX.md) and the [docs/ index](docs/README.md).

## Where to discuss

Discord: [Crynta OS](https://discord.gg/tyveTUyEp7)

Use Discord for design discussion, scope questions, "should I work on X?", quick feedback. Use GitHub Issues for tracking concrete bugs and features.

## What makes a good contribution

These get merged fast:

- **Bug fixes** with clear reproduction steps.
- **Docs / typos / small UX fixes** - open a PR directly.
- **Pre-discussed features** - alignment in an issue or Discord first.
- **Small, focused changes** - easy to review, low risk.

If your change is small and obvious (typo, narrow bugfix, small docs change), open a PR directly. No issue required.

## Keep changes focused

**Only change what's needed to accomplish your stated goal.**

If you're fixing a bug in `terminal.tsx`, don't also:

- Reformat other files
- Clean up unrelated code
- Fix lint issues in files you didn't need to touch
- Combine multiple unrelated fixes in one PR

Even when these changes are "improvements", they make review harder and slow everything down. If you want to clean things up, open a separate PR after discussion.

**One PR = one logical change.** Multi-concern PRs will be asked to split.

## Discuss first (required for larger changes)

For anything beyond a small fix, **discussion is required before opening a PR**. This includes:

- New features
- UI/UX changes or changes to default behavior
- Refactors or "cleanup" work
- Performance rewrites
- Architectural changes
- Anything touching many files or systems
- New autocomplete model providers

Pull requests with significant unsolicited changes will be closed without detailed review. This isn't meant to discourage contribution. It ensures alignment before significant work goes in.

A 10-minute conversation saves a 500-line PR that doesn't fit the roadmap.

## Quality bar

Terax positions itself as **lightweight, fast, production-grade**. Every PR is reviewed against:

- `pnpm lint` clean
- `pnpm check-types` clean
- `pnpm test` clean
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` clean
- `cargo nextest run --locked` clean (or `cargo test --locked`)
- `cargo fmt` applied before pushing
- No perf regressions in known hot paths: terminal renderer, PTY stream, source control, file explorer
- No new heavy dependencies (>50KB gzip in client bundle, >5MB compiled on Rust side) without justification
- Platform parity preserved (macOS / Linux / Windows / WSL still work)
- Security review for changes to file system access, network paths, IPC commands

If you're not sure how to measure perf or what counts as a hot path, ask in Discord or an issue. Better to confirm than get bounced.

## Changes to core subsystems require a test

The most common way a PR breaks Terax is a **local fix with global blast radius**: the diff solves one reported case, reads fine, passes type-check and clippy, and silently breaks the same subsystem in every other case. Review alone does not catch these. A test does.

So if your change touches behavior in any of these load-bearing paths, the PR must add or extend a test that locks the invariant you're relying on:

- **Shell/terminal spawn**: what shell launches, with which cwd, env, and login flags. A "fix" here can stop terminals from starting entirely.
- **Workspace authorization**: which directories spawns and git may operate in. Both the allow and the deny side.
- **Git command layer**: repo-root resolution, pathspec/argument guards, status parsing.
- **Filesystem mutation**: atomic writes, symlink handling, no-data-loss on partial failure.
- **IPC command surface**: anything the webview can invoke.
- **Pure logic with wide reach**: cwd inheritance, tab/split tree transforms, OSC/prompt parsing, the command guard.

The bar for the test is real coverage of the contract, not a placeholder. Test the case that would actually break: the edge, the deny path, the "what happens one level above home". If you can't see how to test it, ask in Discord before opening the PR. That conversation is usually shorter than the revert.

UI rendering, themes, syntax-highlight tables, and anything the type-checker already guarantees do not need tests.

## What Terax is not

To set expectations:

- Terax is terminal-first, not an IDE clone. Focused capabilities such as LSP, AI autocomplete, formatting, source control, and previews belong when they stay fast, lazy, and resource-bounded.
- Not building: Jupyter-style workspaces, integrated debugger and profiler suites, package manager UIs, a full web browser, unbounded background indexing, or an IDE-scale extension host.
- This is not a curated "first open-source contribution" project. Beginners are welcome but expect normal review.
- Mechanical refactors, broad style changes, drive-by rewrites are not helpful.
- AI-assisted contributions are welcome, but the PR must reflect understanding of the existing patterns. Low-effort AI-generated code that wasn't read by the author will be closed.

## Branches

Branch off `main`. Use these prefixes (kebab-case):

| Prefix       | Use for                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`      | New feature                              |
| `fix/`       | Bug fix                                  |
| `chore/`     | Refactor, tooling, config, dependencies  |
| `docs/`      | Docs-only changes                        |
| `perf/`      | Performance work                         |
| `security/`  | Security fix or hardening                |

Examples: `feat/split-panes`, `fix/explorer-focus`, `security/path-guard`.

Don't open PRs from your fork's `main` branch. Work on a feature branch.

## Commits & PRs

The **PR title becomes the squash commit** for most PRs. Multi-commit PRs with well-crafted atomic commits may be merged with a merge commit at the maintainer's discretion (security audits, multi-step refactors). Title must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(terminal): add split panes
fix(explorer): prevent input from disappearing on create
chore(deps): bump tauri to 2.x
security(net): tighten proxy path guard
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `security`.

Common scopes: `terminal`, `editor`, `explorer`, `pty`, `models`, `agents`, `settings`, `tabs`, `shortcuts`, `ui`, `git`, `preview`, `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `wsl`.

Within a PR, individual commit messages can be free-form (they get squashed or grouped).

**Fill out the PR template.** Include: what changed, why, how you tested. Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes. "Tested manually by ..." is the bare minimum.

**Open a draft PR early** if you want feedback mid-flight. Mark "Ready for review" when done.

### What gets merged faster

- Clear problem statement
- Small, focused diff
- Follows existing patterns (read 2-3 nearby files before writing yours)
- All type-checks / lints / tests pass
- Manual testing notes describing the steps you took

### What gets bounced back

- Mixed-concern PRs
- Large architectural PRs without prior discussion
- New dependencies without justification
- Breaking changes without migration notes
- Incidental reformatting unrelated to the change
- AI-generated code that obviously wasn't read by the author

## Code style

- Follow existing patterns. Read 2-3 adjacent files before adding new ones.
- TypeScript: no `any` unless you really mean it. Strict mode is on.
- Rust: `cargo fmt` + `clippy` clean.
- Comments: only for *why*, not *what*. Code should explain itself. No multi-paragraph docstrings.
- No emojis in code or commit messages.
- American English in user-facing strings.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I ask before fixing a typo or obvious bug?**
A: No, open a PR directly.

**Q: I have an idea for a new feature.**
A: Open a GitHub issue or bring it to Discord. Don't open a PR without prior discussion.

**Q: My PR was closed without detailed feedback.**
A: Usually means it didn't align with project direction, or scope was too large to review responsibly. This is normal for a solo project. Reopen is welcome if you want to take another pass at a smaller scope.

**Q: Can I work on an open issue?**
A: Comment first to confirm it's still relevant and nobody else is on it. For anything non-trivial, discuss approach before implementing.

**Q: I noticed cleaner code I could write while working on my fix.**
A: Focus on your stated goal. Submit cleanup as a separate PR after discussion if it matters.

**Q: How long does review take?**
A: Depends. Small bug fix or docs: usually within a few days. Larger feature: maybe a week or two. Pre-discussed work moves faster.

**Q: Why did my PR for a new autocomplete provider get closed?**
A: Most provider requests are now covered by the `openai-compatible` provider (point it at any OpenAI-compatible base URL) or OpenRouter. New built-in providers must justify unique value beyond what those cover.

**Q: My PR conflicts after main moved. Should I rebase?**
A: If the change is still relevant and reasonably small, yes. If it's a large stale PR, expect it to be closed with an offer to reopen after rebase. Rotting velocity is real, not personal.
