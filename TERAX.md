# TERAX.md

`TERAX.md` is the project's living architecture doc - read it before making changes. External coding agents (pi, Claude Code, etc.) pick up root-level memory files like this one by convention.

## Project

**Terax**: open-source AI-native terminal emulator. Tauri 2 + Rust (`portable-pty`) backend, React 19 + TypeScript + xterm.js (webgl) client, editor AI autocomplete via Vercel AI SDK v6, and first-class integration for terminal coding agents.

- Bundle id: `app.crynta.terax`
- Package manager: **pnpm**
- Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows
- Frontend checks: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`, `pnpm test`
- Rust checks: `cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked` (local fallback: `cargo test --locked`)

## Quality bar

Production-grade or it does not ship. Every change is judged against all of these, not just "it works":

- **Correctness**: edge cases, failure modes, concurrent access. No "works for now".
- **Performance**: ultra-lightweight is the product. ~7-8 MB bundle, high-performance terminal. For every change ask: how much RAM it costs, whether it adds IPC round-trips or redundant requests, whether it triggers extra re-renders or wasted work, whether it pulls a heavy dependency. Unused features consume zero resources.
- **Security**: no critical security holes. Validate at every boundary (IPC, fs, network).
- **UI/UX**: polished, professional, premium. Every state and detail considered.
- **Architecture**: new or changed logic lives in pure, dependency-light functions (functional core); tauri commands and React components stay thin (imperative shell). Keeps it testable without a later rewrite.

Verify before claiming done:

- Frontend: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`, `pnpm test`
- Rust: `cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cd src-tauri && cargo nextest run --locked` (or `cargo test --locked`)

A change to a core subsystem (terminal/shell spawn, workspace auth, git, fs, IPC) needs a test that locks the invariant.

## Conventions

- **Comments**: default to none, the code should explain itself. If genuinely needed, 1-2 lines on *why*, never *what*. No AI-generic filler.
- **No em-dash** anywhere: code, comments, commits, docs.
- **No emojis** anywhere.
- **Imports**: always `@/...` on the frontend, never relative across modules.
- **pnpm only**, never npm/npx/yarn.

## Architecture

### Two-process model

**Rust (`src-tauri/`)** owns all OS access. The webview never touches the FS, processes, or shells directly - everything goes through `invoke()` calls to commands registered in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`:

- `pty::pty_*` - long-lived interactive PTY sessions (xterm ↔ portable-pty), managed by `PtyState` (`RwLock<HashMap<id, Session>>`). Output streams via a Tauri `Channel<PtyEvent>`.
- `fs::tree::*` (`fs_read_dir`, `list_subdirs`), `fs::file::*` (`fs_read_file`, `fs_write_file`, `fs_stat`, `fs_canonicalize`), `fs::mutate::*` (`fs_create_file`, `fs_create_dir`, `fs_rename`, `fs_delete`): file explorer + editor IO.
- `fs::search::*` (`fs_search`, `fs_list_files`), `fs::grep::*` (`fs_grep`, `fs_glob`): fuzzy file finder + content search (powered by `ignore` + `grep-*` crates).
- `git::commands::*`: full source-control surface (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_diff_content`, `git_stage`, `git_unstage`, `git_discard`, `git_commit`, `git_fetch`, `git_pull_ff_only`, `git_push`, `git_log`, `git_show_commit`, `git_commit_files`, `git_commit_file_diff`, `git_panel_snapshot`, `git_resolve_repo`, `git_remote_url`). All gated through the workspace authorization registry.
- `shell::shell_run_command`: one-shot subshell exec (used by editor external formatting). Distinct from PTY sessions; not the user's interactive terminal. On Windows via PowerShell (`-NoProfile -Command`), on Unix via `$SHELL -lc`. Shared helper `build_oneshot_command`.
- `shell::shell_session_*`: persistent shell sessions with state across calls. `shell::shell_bg_*` (`spawn`, `logs`, `kill`, `list`): long-running background processes (dev servers etc.) with bounded ring-buffer log capture.
- `workspace::*`: `workspace_authorize` / `workspace_current_dir` (the spawn/git cwd authorization registry) plus the WSL bridge (`wsl_list_distros`, `wsl_default_distro`, `wsl_home`).
- `lsp::*` (`lsp_detect`, `lsp_host_pid`, `lsp_resolve_root`, `lsp_spawn`, `lsp_send`, `lsp_kill`): language server process host. Dumb JSON-RPC pipe: Content-Length framing + process lifecycle in Rust (`lsp/framing.rs`, pure + tested), protocol intelligence on the frontend. Spawn cwd gated through the workspace registry; binaries resolve via the captured login-shell env (`lsp/env.rs`, GUI apps get a bare PATH on macOS); root detection walks up to markers but never to or above `$HOME`. Servers run in their own process group on Unix and are group-killed (cargo check / proc-macro children die with the server); Windows children get a `proc::job::ProcessJob` (kill-on-close, shared with pty). All sessions killed on `RunEvent::Exit`.
- `net::*` (`ai_http_stream`, `lm_ping`): HTTP proxy with SSRF guard; keeps autocomplete provider calls and local-model pings off the webview.
- `secrets::secrets_*`: OS keychain via the `keyring` crate. Service constant `terax-ai`. Linux uses a file-based fallback gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`.
- `open_settings_window`: separate webview window for Settings (optional `tab` arg deep-links a section).
- `vibrancy::window_*`: native window backdrop (`window_backdrop_kind`, `window_set_backdrop`). macOS gets `NSVisualEffectMaterial::UnderWindowBackground`, Windows 11 gets Mica (gated on build >= 22000 via `RtlGetVersion`, since `apply_mica` fails on Windows 10), Linux reports `none` because blur there belongs to the compositor. The `window-vibrancy` crate is a macOS/Windows-only dependency so Linux builds never pull it.

### PTY shell integration

PTY shells are bootstrapped via injected init scripts in `src-tauri/src/modules/pty/scripts/`:

- **Unix** (`zshenv.zsh`, `zprofile.zsh`, `zlogin.zsh`, `zshrc.zsh`, `bashrc.bash`) for zsh/bash, plus `init.fish` installed to `~/.config/fish/conf.d/terax.fish` for fish. Emit OSC 7 (cwd) and OSC 133 A/B/C/D (prompt boundaries + exit code) so the host can track cwd and detect command boundaries without re-parsing the prompt. Fish 4.0+ writes its own OSC 133 prompt markers; Terax sets `fish_features=no-mark-prompt` and re-asserts its own prompt via `-C` to avoid doubling.
- **Windows** (`profile.ps1`) - passed via `pwsh -NoLogo -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path>`. Wraps the user's existing `prompt` function (after their `$PROFILE` runs) to emit OSC 7 + OSC 133 A/B/D. Shell priority: `pwsh.exe` (PS 7+) → `powershell.exe` (PS 5.1) → `cmd.exe` (no integration). cwd is normalized to backslashes before being passed to ConPTY (`CreateProcessW` misbehaves with forward-slash cwd).

`pty/shell_init.rs` is split into `#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` modules - keep new platform-specific code in the right cfg arm.

ConPTY on Windows requires `SPAWN_LOCK` (Mutex) around `openpty + spawn_command` in `session.rs`. Concurrent spawns leave one of the resulting PTYs with a stalled output pipe. Don't remove the lock without verifying first-tab stability under fast tab spam.

Each ConPTY child is also assigned to a per-session **Job Object** with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` (`pty/job.rs`). When the Job HANDLE drops - clean shutdown, panic, or even SIGKILL'd Terax process - the kernel kills every descendant of the shell (e.g. `npm run dev` spawned from inside pwsh). Without this Windows orphans the entire process subtree because `TerminateProcess` only kills the immediate child. macOS/Linux rely on `Drop for Session → killer.kill()`; on dev-`Ctrl-C` of `cargo run` destructors don't fire and orphans are possible there too - acceptable for now since dev only.

### Frontend (`src/`)

Single-window React app. Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`. Tabs are a tagged union (`kind`: `terminal` | `editor` | `preview` | `markdown` | `git-diff` | `git-history` | `git-commit-file`) and **not** unmounted on switch - they're hidden via `invisible pointer-events-none` so PTYs and dev servers keep streaming in the background.

`App.tsx` wires modules together - keep it a coordinator. New features go inside the appropriate `modules/<area>/`.

### Module layout (`src/modules/`)

Each module is self-contained, exports a thin barrel via `index.ts`, and owns its hooks under `lib/`.

- **terminal/** - `TerminalStack` keeps one mounted xterm per tab via `useTerminalSession` + `pty-bridge`. `osc-handlers.ts` parses OSC 7 (with Windows drive-letter normalization: `/C:/Users/foo` → `C:/Users/foo`) and OSC 133 markers. The xterm color palette is driven by the central theme engine (`modules/theme`), not a local table. Renderer slots are pooled (`rendererPool.ts`, max 5): a hidden leaf with a foreground job (OSC 133 C..D, agent signal, or `pty_has_foreground_job`) keeps its live grid parked with rendering paused via `display:none`; an idle hidden leaf releases its slot but the buffer is retained and serialized lazily only when another leaf steals it. The `DormantRing` (1 MiB, no terminal reset on overflow) buffers bytes only for leaves whose slot was stolen or never bound. Never serialize a leaf that is mid-command: replaying incremental TUI repaints over a snapshot is what used to wipe Claude Code.
- **editor/** - CodeMirror 6 stack (`EditorStack` mirrors `TerminalStack`). `extensions.ts` configures language modes; supports vim mode. Buffers live in LF space and the original EOL (`lib/eol.ts`, majority-vote detection) is restored on save; indent unit/tab size are detected per file (`lib/indent.ts`) via a per-pane compartment. Saves are conflict-checked against the disk mtime returned by `fs_read_file`/`fs_write_file` (mismatch → warning toast with explicit Overwrite, never silent last-writer-wins); external format-on-save only applies the disk read-back if the doc is unchanged since the save snapshot. Files over 10 MB offer "Open anyway" (hard cap 50 MB, `force` arg); above 4 MB syntax highlighting and LSP stay off. Cmd-F routes to CodeMirror's own search panel (find/replace/regex) when an editor tab is active, Ctrl-G opens go-to-line; both panels styled in `chromeTheme.ts`. Format-on-save formatters live in `lib/externalFormat.ts` (`FORMATTERS` registry: biome, prettier, ruff, rustfmt, gofmt, clang-format, shfmt, zig fmt, plus a custom `{file}` command template); `resolveFormatter` applies per-language overrides (`editorFormatterByLang`) over the global default, and a global external default only runs on languages its tool understands. Diff panes resolve the language before mounting CodeMirror: a late compartment reconfigure leaves the merge view's deleted-chunk widgets unhighlighted. AI inline completion (`lib/autocomplete/`) sends the buffer's indent unit with the request and normalizes unambiguous tab/space mismatches in responses (`normalizeIndent.ts`); triggering is `autocompleteTrigger` auto or manual, with `editor.aiComplete` / `editor.codeComplete` registry shortcuts (guarded to editor tabs so the keys fall through to terminals), and Tab accepts an open completion popup before the ghost. Multi-line ghosts render first-line-inline plus a block widget below the line (never inline `<br>`s); a closers-only line-suffix (cursor inside `fn(|)`) is hidden and re-appended after the block so the preview equals the accept result, and a line-suffix with real code caps the ghost to one line (`capToLineSuffix`). Suggestions echoing the recent prefix are dropped, multi-line suggestions and closing brackets never start on a line that ends with `;`, and closer-only lines are reindented from the previous line (`trimSuggestion`/`reindentClosers`, all tested). Markdown editing is GFM (`markdownLanguage` base) with fenced-code highlighting resolved through the shared lazy language registry, Cmd/Ctrl+Click URLs, and clickable task checkboxes (`markdownExtras.ts`, all inside the lazy markdown chunk; the eager-budget test enforces this). Dotenv files (`.env`, `.env.*`, and `*.env`) use the lazy shell grammar. Editor theme is decoupled from the app theme: the `editorTheme` pref is `"auto" | EditorThemeId` (default `"auto"`), resolved at render time by `useEditorThemeExt` via `resolveEditorThemeId`. In `auto` the editor follows the active app theme's `editorTheme[mode]` pairing (live, never stale); an explicit pick overrides. Theme ids + labels live in `settings/store.ts` (`EDITOR_THEMES`/`EDITOR_THEME_LABELS`); the matching extensions in `editor/lib/themes.ts` (`EDITOR_THEME_EXT`). Prebuilt `@uiw` themes plus locally-built ones in `editor/lib/cmThemes.ts` (Kanagawa wave/lotus/dragon, Everforest, Dracula, Solarized, Catppuccin, Rosé Pine) via `createTheme` (no extra deps). The CM surfaces (`EditorPane`, `GitDiffPane`) all read the theme through `useEditorThemeExt`.
  Editor code size is stored separately as `editorFontSize` and does not affect `terminalFontSize`.
- **explorer/** - file tree with Material/Catppuccin icons (`iconResolver.ts`), fuzzy search, keyboard nav, inline rename, context actions. Backslash-aware `basename`.
- **preview/** - auto-detected dev-server preview tab (status-bar pill suggests opening when a localhost URL is detected).
- **tabs/** - `useTabs` is the source of truth for tab list + active id. `useWorkspaceCwd` derives explorer root + inherited cwd for new tabs from active tab. `basename` splits on both `/` and `\`.
- **header/** - top bar + inline search (`SearchInline` adapts to terminal vs editor via `SearchTarget`). `WindowControls` rendered when `USE_CUSTOM_WINDOW_CONTROLS` is true (Linux + Windows; macOS uses native traffic lights).
- **statusbar/** - bottom bar, `CwdBreadcrumb` (handles Unix paths, Windows drive letters, and home `~` segments via `pathUtils.segmentsFromCwd`).
- **shortcuts/** - keymap registry (`shortcuts.ts`) + `useGlobalShortcuts`. Handlers live in `App.tsx` and are passed in by id (`tab.new`, `editor.aiComplete`, …). `metaKey || ctrlKey` for cross-platform Cmd/Ctrl.
- **settings/** - settings store (`store.ts` via `tauri-plugin-store`), preferences hook, settings window opener.
- **sidebar/** - activity bar + collapsible side panels (explorer, source control, git history).
- **source-control/** - git status / stage / commit panel and diff workflow.
- **git-history/** - commit graph rail, refs, per-commit file diffs.
- **lsp/** - opt-in language server support, zero cost until enabled (no process, no PATH check, nothing in the eager bundle beyond a 14.5 kB shell). Statusbar pill offers Enable (binary found) or Install (with copyable command) per language; activation persists as `lspActivation` in the settings store (`enabled`/`dismissed`/unset). `sessionManager.ts` keys sessions by (server, workspace root), refcounts open docs, idle-kills after 3 min, and crash-backoffs (cooldown before respawn; 3 in 5 min → give up + toast with the server's stderr tail). Resource invariants: **no root marker → no session** (a dirname fallback once spawned a server per directory and burned GBs), hard cap of 4 sessions per server, lean per-preset `initializationOptions` (rust-analyzer: `cachePriming` off + bounded `lru`; tsls: `maxTsServerMemory`). Client is `codemirror-languageserver` behind a lazy import, subclassed (`lib/client.ts`) to add didClose/didSave/shutdown, `textDocument/references` (Shift-F12; multi-result definitions and references share the `locationsPanel.ts` picker) and the publishDiagnostics capability the lib forgets (tsls sends no diagnostics without it); `lib/transport.ts` bridges to the Rust pipe and answers server-to-client requests the lib ignores. `vscode-languageserver-protocol` is aliased to a 4-enum shim in vite.config.ts (~117 kB saved). Presets: typescript, rust-analyzer, pyright, ruff, gopls and more; custom stdio servers via Settings. Several presets can claim one language (pyright and ruff both take `py`): `serverForLanguage` prefers the enabled candidate, so enabling ruff while pyright is unset or dismissed routes Python to ruff. WSL workspaces excluded for now.
- **markdown/** - markdown preview renderer (backs the `markdown` tab kind).
- **workspace/** - workspace environment switching (Local + WSL distros).
- **theme/** - custom theme engine (no `next-themes`). `ThemeProvider` + `applyTheme` write CSS variables; built-in presets in `themes/` (terax-default - colours live in `globals.css` since ThemeProvider clears rather than applies for that id - xcode, claude, kanagawa, kanagawa-dragon, tokyo-night, catppuccin, rose-pine, everforest, nord, gruvbox, dracula, solarized, tide, sage, caffeine), each optionally declaring an `editorTheme` pairing consumed by `resolveEditorThemeId` (see editor/). User themes via `customThemes.ts` + `validateTheme.ts`, optional background image via `bgImageStore.ts` + `SurfaceLayer`.
- **updater/** - auto-updater UI built on `tauri-plugin-updater`.
- **agents/** - launching, notifications, and management for terminal coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Grok). The header launcher (`components/AgentLauncherPanel.tsx` + `lib/launcher.ts`) persists per-agent start commands in preferences and atomically builds balanced one-to-four-pane tabs. Shared store (`store/agentStore.ts`: terminal `sessions` + `notifications`) and a shared router (`lib/route.ts`: suppress when focused-and-visible, OS-notify when unfocused, in-app Sonner toast when focused-but-hidden) feed the header `NotificationBell` (management surface with per-agent hook enable rows). Toasts use Sonner (`components/ui/sonner.tsx`) themed via the central engine; `lib/agentIcon.tsx` renders the per-agent brand mark. Terminal detection is Rust-side (`pty/agent_detect.rs`) on the PTY reader's byte filter, armed on `OSC 133;C;<cmd>` or self-armed by the marker, emitting `terax:agent-signal` transitions (`started`/`working`/`attention`/`finished`/`exited`) driven only by OSC sequences (never raw output, so a repainting TUI never flaps) - zero cost when no agent runs. Hook-backed terminal agents converge on the same `OSC 777` marker the detector reads, installed via `agent_enable_hooks(agent)` / `agent_hooks_status(agent)` in `modules/agent.rs` (data-driven `AgentSpec` for JSON-hook agents plus a Terax-owned Pi extension; atomic writes, foreign configuration preserved, idempotent; gated on `TERAX_TERMINAL`). OpenCode and Grok use OSC 133 process-lifecycle detection but do not install attention hooks. Delivery differs because only Claude's hook protocol can return terminal bytes in the hook *response*: **Claude** (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `UserPromptSubmit`/`Notification`/`Stop`) returns the marker via the `terminalSequence` field (legacy 3-field `notify;Terax;<event>`). **Codex** (`~/.codex/hooks.json`, `UserPromptSubmit`/`PermissionRequest`/`Stop`) and **Gemini** (`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `BeforeAgent`/`Notification`/`AfterAgent`, `matcher:"*"`) can't, so the hook *command* emits the 4-field `notify;Terax;<agent>;<event>` marker itself (`printf > /dev/tty` on Unix, or `terax __terax_notify` writing to `CONOUT$` after `AttachConsole` on Windows) and prints `{}` as a JSON stdout no-op (Codex's `Stop` and Gemini both reject empty/non-JSON stdout). **Pi** (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/terax-notifications.ts`) uses `agent_start`/`agent_settled` extension events and writes its named marker directly to stdout. The agent-named marker lets a self-arm name the right agent when no preexec fired (bash/tmux/Windows).
- **command-palette/** - modal command palette (`CommandPalette.tsx`, `commands.ts`) for actions and navigation.
- **spaces/** - workspace spaces/projects (name, root, env, color, per-space tab persistence) via `useSpaces` and `SpaceSwitcher`.

### Model providers (`src/lib/models/`)

BYOK configuration shared by editor autocomplete. Cloud providers via `@ai-sdk/*`: **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Cerebras, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter**, plus **OpenAI-compatible** for any custom base URL. Local / offline providers (key-optional, model id supplied at runtime): **LM Studio, MLX, Ollama**. Provider list in `config.ts` (`PROVIDERS`); model registry includes `DEFAULT_AUTOCOMPLETE_MODEL`. Provider adapters (`buildLanguageModel` / `buildConfiguredLanguageModel` in `language-model.ts`) build AI SDK v6 model instances; local and custom endpoints route through the Rust HTTP proxy (`proxy-fetch.ts` → `ai_http_stream`) so private-network base URLs work from the sandboxed webview.

- **Key storage**: OS keychain via `keyring` (Rust). Frontend reads/writes through `secrets_*` commands (`keyring.ts`). Service `KEYRING_SERVICE = "terax-ai"`. Never persist keys to disk, settings store, or `localStorage`.
- **Settings UI**: the Models tab in the settings window manages providers, keys, custom endpoints, and the autocomplete model selection.

### UI conventions

- **shadcn/ui** is configured (`components.json`, style `radix-luma`, base `mist`, icon lib **hugeicons**). Primitives in `src/components/ui/` - don't hand-edit; re-run `pnpm dlx shadcn add` to upgrade.
- **Tailwind v4** - no `tailwind.config.*`, config is in `src/App.css` via `@theme`. Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.
- Animation: `motion` (Framer Motion successor). Resizable layout: `react-resizable-panels`.
- **Window vibrancy**: the `windowVibrancy` pref drives `WindowVibrancyBridge` (main window only - `window_set_backdrop` targets its caller). `html[data-vibrancy="on"]` makes `<html>`/`<body>` transparent and redefines `--frame` with alpha, so only the chrome frosts; panes keep `--background` so terminal text stays on a solid surface and the xterm canvas still matches its container. The opaque colour the pre-paint script parks on `<html>` would cover the backdrop, so `applyVibrancy` clears it while the effect is on; there is deliberately no localStorage fast path, since pre-declaring the effect would show a see-through window on any launch where the native call has not landed yet. Repeat applications are deduped, and only Mica is rebuilt on a light/dark flip (NSVisualEffectView adapts on its own).
- **Floating panes**: header and status bar are window chrome painted on `--frame` (derived from `--card`, so no theme declares it); the sidebar and the tab surface are `.terax-pane` cards on `--background` - same tone as the xterm canvas. Panes meet the chrome flush and are inset only horizontally, because the header centers its content and any vertical gutter would stack onto that padding and read as asymmetric. `.terax-pane` carries no drop shadow: `react-resizable-panels` clips panel content at the panel box, so a shadow would only render on the gutter sides.
- Path imports: always `@/…`, never relative across modules.
- Cross-platform paths: anywhere a path may originate from OSC 7, the explorer, or the OS, normalize separators with `.split(/[\\/]/)` rather than `.split("/")`.
- Canonical path form on the frontend is **forward-slash**. `homeDir()` returns backslashes on Windows; convert at the boundary (App.tsx setHome). OSC 7 already arrives as forward-slash. Equal canonical strings keep `useFileTree` from wiping its tree and flashing the explorer when `tab.cwd` first arrives.

### Window styling

- macOS: `titleBarStyle: Overlay` + `hiddenTitle: true` in `tauri.conf.json` (native traffic lights via overlay). `transparent: true` + `macOSPrivateApi: true` in `tauri.conf.json` are what `NSVisualEffectView` requires; that also means the macOS build uses a private API and is not App Store eligible.
- Linux: `decorations: false` + `transparent: true` from `tauri.linux.conf.json`; re-asserted post-realize for GNOME/Mutter CSD.
- Windows: same as Linux via `tauri.windows.conf.json`. React renders custom `WindowControls`.

### Tauri capabilities

`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` is the allowlist for plugin APIs available to the webview. New plugins (dialog, autostart, updater, window-state, store, opener, os, log are wired in `lib.rs`) typically need:

1. `Cargo.toml` dependency
2. `.plugin(...)` call in `lib.rs` `run()`
3. capability entry in `default.json`

### Cross-platform conventions

- HOME / cache dirs: use the `dirs` crate (`dirs::home_dir()`, `dirs::cache_dir()`), never raw `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%`.
- Shell init scripts: gate Unix-only logic behind `#[cfg(unix)]`; Windows arm in `pty::shell_init::windows`.
- Terminal input: send `\r` (CR) for Enter, not `\n` (LF) - PowerShell on Windows requires CR.

### Bundle config

- `bundle.targets: "all"` plus per-platform sections in `tauri.conf.json`:
  - **macOS**: `minimumSystemVersion: 10.15`.
  - **Linux**: deb depends `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`, `libgtk-3-0`; rpm `webkit2gtk4.1`, `gtk3`; AppImage bundles its media framework.
  - **Windows**: NSIS installer in `currentUser` mode (no admin required), WebView2 via `embedBootstrapper` (offline install).
- Auto-updater configured with a public minisign key; release artifacts at `https://github.com/crynta/terax-ai/releases/latest/download/latest.json`.

### Known gotchas

- **React 19 strict mode** double-mounts `useEffect` in dev → terminals spawn twice on first render. The first PTY is cleaned up almost immediately. The `SPAWN_LOCK` mutex serializes this; don't be alarmed by `pty opened id=1` followed by `pty closed id=1` in dev logs.
- **Windows PowerShell process lifecycle**: `killer.kill()` from `portable-pty` only kills the immediate child. Descendants (e.g. `npm run dev` started inside pwsh) survive unless something else takes them down. The Job Object in `pty/job.rs` handles this for the Terax-process-death case; an explicit `pty_close` from JS also kills only the immediate child + relies on the Job to take the rest. Don't disable the Job without a replacement.
- **Tab `cwd` storage**: comes from OSC 7 with forward slashes (after `parseOsc7` strips `/C:` → `C:`). Anything that consumes `tab.cwd` and passes it to a Rust fs command on Windows must normalize separators or accept both forms - `apply_common` in `pty::shell_init` handles this for PTY spawn; other call sites must do their own.
